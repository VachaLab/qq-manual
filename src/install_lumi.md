# Installing on LUMI

To install qq on the LUMI supercomputer, log in to `lumi.csc.fi` and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/VachaLab/qq/releases/latest/download/qq-lumi-install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest version of qq and installs it to the shared home directory of the cluster nodes.

To complete the installation, open a new terminal or source your `.bashrc` file.
