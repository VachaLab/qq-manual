# Installing on Karolina

To install qq on the Karolina supercomputer (IT4Innovations), log in to `karolina.it4i.cz` and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Ladme/qq/releases/latest/download/qq-karolina-install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest version of qq and installs it to the shared home directory of the cluster nodes.

To complete the installation, open a new terminal or source your `.bashrc` file.
