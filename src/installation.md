# Installation

This section explains how to easily install qq on different clusters.

All installation scripts assume that you are using bash as your shell. If you use a different shell, follow [this section](install_general.md#installing-a-pre-built-version-for-other-shells) of the manual.

## Updating qq

To **reinstall** or **update** qq on a cluster, just run the installation command for the given cluster again.

> **Warning:** Updating qq while you have running qq jobs is not recommended as it may potentially cause your jobs to crash!
