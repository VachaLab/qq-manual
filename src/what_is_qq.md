# What is qq?

**qq** is a wrapper around batch scheduling systems designed to simplify job submission and management. It is inspired by [NCBR's Infinity ABS](https://infinity.ncbr.muni.cz/) but aims to be more decentralized and easier to extend. It also supports both PBS Pro and Slurm, while making it straightforward to add compatibility with other batch systems as needed.

Although qq and Infinity ABS share the same philosophy and use very similar commands, they share no code.

> **Disclaimer:** qq is developed for the internal use of the [Robert Vácha Lab](https://vacha.ceitec.cz/) and may not work on your clusters or for your applications.
